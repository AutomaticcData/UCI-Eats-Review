## UCI-Eats-Review
###### Team project to review places to eat near UCI

* My primary role was mainly to code, verify sources of information and prepare data/resources for presentation.


* Our project is to use Yelp to determine which restaurants are the most popular within a two mile radius of our classroom. 
We are hungry, busy students with work, families and class responsibilities, with little time to grab a bite. 
We’d like to know where the UCI campus community gets their sustenance. We’d also like to know if there is any preference by this community regarding price point, cuisine, or distance

What restaurants were closest to our location?
Which restaurants are the most affordable?
Which restaurants are the most popular by rating among the community?
Which restaurants are least recommended by the community?
Which restaurants had the most reviews?
How do we get to these restaurants?
Which restaurant was the best option for distance, affordability, rating, and reviews?

###### Hypothesis
There are more than 40 restaurants within a two mile radius of location from which to purchase meals before and after class with affordable price points and ratings.

###### Null Hypothesis
If there are not more than 40 restaurants from which to choose within a 2 mile radius, then students will need to bring their own food

###### Data Exploration
Based on our review of the Yelp data, we determined our 2 mile radius was not feasible.
In order to determine the best place to “grab a bite to eat”, we reduced the radius to 1 mile to highlight establishments that can be walked to in less than 20 minutes.
Our data now reflects a 1 mile radius vs. 2 mile radius.
